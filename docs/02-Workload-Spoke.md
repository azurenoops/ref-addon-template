# Deploy the Workload Spoke Virtual Network

The following will be created:

* Resource Groups for Spoke Networking
* Spoke Networks (Workload)

Review and if needed, comment out and modify the variables within the "02 Workload Spoke Virtual Network" section of the common variable definitons file [parameters.tfvars](./tfvars/parameters.tfvars). Do not modify if you plan to use the default values.

Sample:

```bash

#######################################
# 02 Workload Spoke Virtual Network ###
#######################################

wl_name               = "wl-core"
wl_vnet_address_space = ["10.8.1.0/24"]
wl_subnets = {
  default = {
    name                                       = "wl-core"
    address_prefixes                           = ["10.8.1.224/27"]
    service_endpoints                          = ["Microsoft.Storage"]
    private_endpoint_network_policies_enabled  = false
    private_endpoint_service_endpoints_enabled = true
    nsg_subnet_inbound_rules = [
      # [name, description, priority, direction, access, protocol, destination_port_range, source_address_prefixes, destination_address_prefix]
      # Use "" for description to use default description
      # To use defaults, use [""] without adding any value and to use this subnet as a source or destination prefix.      
      ["Allow-Traffic-From-Spokes", "Allow traffic from spokes", "200", "Inbound", "Allow", "*", ["22", "80", "443", "3389"], [""], ["10.8.1.0/24"]],
    ]
  }
}
wl_private_dns_zones                          = []
enable_forced_tunneling_on_wl_route_table     = true
is_wl_spoke_deployed_to_same_hub_subscription = true

```

After Modifying the variables, move on to deploying the Azure App Service.
