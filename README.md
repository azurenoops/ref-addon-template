# Deploy a SCCA compliant Workload Spoke with an <type of workload> addon using Terraform and GitHub #

This reference implementation shows how to create a SCCA compliant Workload Spoke with an <type of workload> workload using:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) as infrastructure as code (IaC) tool to build, change, and version the infrastructure on Azure in a safe, repeatable, and efficient way.
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.Use these pipelines to automate the deployment and undeployment of the entire infrastructure on multiple environments on the Azure platform.

## Architecture ##

The following picture shows the high-level architecture created by the Terraform modules included in this reference implementation:

The architecture is composed of the following elements:

<describe resoureces that are in the module>

## Limitations ##

<describe Limitations that are in the module, if any>

## Requirements ##

There are some requirements you need to complete before we can deploy Terraform modules using Github.

- Store the Terraform state file to an Azure storage account. For more information on how to create to use a storage account to store remote Terraform state, state locking, and encryption at rest, see [Store Terraform state in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/store-state-in-azure-storage?tabs=azure-cli)

### GitHub ##

- Create an GitHub Project. For more information, see [Create a project in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project)
- Create an [GitHub Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows) to your Azure subscription.

## Terraform State ##

In order to deploy Terraform modules to Azure you can use Github Actions. [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?view=azure-devops) provides developer services for support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications and infrastructure components using IaC technologies such as ARM Templates, Bicep, and Terraform.

Terraform stores [state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html) about your managed infrastructure and configuration in a special file called state file. This state is used by Terraform to map real-world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures. Terraform state is used to reconcile deployed resources with Terraform configurations. When using Terraform to deploy Azure resources, the state allows Terraform to know what Azure resources to add, update, or delete. By default, Terraform state is stored in a local file named "terraform.tfstate", but it can also be stored remotely, which works better in a team environment. Storing the state in a local file isn't ideal for the following reasons:

- Storing the Terraform state in a local file doesn't work well in a team or collaborative environment.
- Terraform state can include sensitive information.
- Storing state locally increases the chance of inadvertent deletion.

Each Terraform configuration can specify a [backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html), which defines where and how operations are performed, where [state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html) snapshots are stored. The [Azure Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) or **azurerm** can be used to configure infrastructure in Microsoft Azure using the Azure Resource Manager API's. Terraform provides a [backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/azurerm.html) for the Azure Provider that allows to store the state as a Blob with the given Key within a given Blob Container inside a Blob Storage Account. This backend also supports state locking and consistency checking via native capabilities of the Azure Blob Storage. [](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/azurerm.html) When using Azure DevOps to deploy services to a cloud environment, you should use this backend to store the state to a remote storage account. For more information on how to create to use a storage account to store remote Terraform state, state locking, and encryption at rest, see [Store Terraform state in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/store-state-in-azure-storage?tabs=azure-cli). Under the [storage-account](./storage-account) folder in this reference implementation, you can find a Terraform module and bash script to deploy an Azure storage account where you can persist the Terraform state as a blob.
